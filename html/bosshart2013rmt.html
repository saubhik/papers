Metamorphosis: Fast Programmable Match-Action Processing in Hardware for
SDN</h1>
<p>Pat Bosshart, Glen Gibb, Hun-Seok Kim, George Varghese, Nick McKeown,
Martin Izzard, Fernando Mujica, and Mark Horowitz. 2013. Forwarding
metamorphosis: fast programmable match-action processing in hardware for
SDN. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2013 conference on SIGCOMM
(SIGCOMM &#x2019;13). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA,
99&#x2013;110. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/2486001.2486011</p>
<p>Routing &amp; forwarding within the network remains a confusing mix
of routing protocols (e.g.&#xA0;BGP, ICMP, MPLS) and forwarding behaviors
(e.g.&#xA0;routers, bridges, firewalls). The control and forwarding planes
are intertwined inside closed, vertically integrated boxes. SDN took a
key step in abstracting network functions by separating the roles of the
control &amp; forwarding planes via an open interface between them,
e.g.&#xA0;OpenFlow. OpenFlow is based on the Match-Action approach. We need
to implement Match-Action at 1 Tb/s speeds in hardware exploiting
pipelining &amp; parallelism while living in the constraints of on-chip
table memories - switching chips are O(100) times faster at switching
than CPUs &amp; O(10) times faster than NPUs.</p>
<p>The simplest approach is Single Match Table (SMT) model where a
controller tells the switch to match any set of packet header fields
against entries in a single match table. It can be easily implemented in
Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). But this table needs to store
every combination of headers, which is wasteful.</p>
<p>Multiple Match Tables (MMT) is a refinement of SMT model. It allows
multiple smaller match tables to be matched by a subset of packet
fields. These match tables are arranged in a pipeline of stages.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-inflexible-match-action-processing">Problem 1:
Inflexible Match-Action Processing</h2>
<p>The OpenFlow spec transitioned to the MMT model but does not mandate
the width, depth, or number of tables. Existing switch chips fix the
width, depth, or number of tables during fabrication. This severely
limits flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>a chip used in core router requires very large 32-bit IP prefix
table &amp; a small 128-bit ACL match table</li>
<li>a chip used for L2 bridge requires 48-bit L2 DA (destination MAC
address) match table &amp; another 48-bit L2 SA (source MAC address)
match table.</li>
<li>entrerprise router requires much smaller 32-bit IP prefix table but
a much larger ACL table and some MAC address match tables</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates problems for network operators who want to tune the
table sizes to optimize for their network, or implement new forwarding
behavior.</p>
<h2
id="problem-2-limited-repertoire-of-packet-processing-actions">Problem
2: Limited repertoire of packet processing actions</h2>
<p>E.g. forwarding, dropping, decrementing TTLs, pushing VLAN or MPLS
headers, &amp; GRE encapsulation. This action set is not extensible
&amp; not abstract enough to allow any field to be modified, any state
machine to be updated, and the packet to be forwarded to an arbitrary
set of output ports.</p>
<p>The paper explores Reconfigurable Match Tables, a refinement of the
MMT model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Field definitions can be altered &amp; new fields added.</li>
<li>The number, topology, widths, depths of match tables can be
specified, subject to overall resource limits on the number of matched
bits.</li>
<li>New actions may be defined, such as writing new congestion
fields.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily modified packets can be placed in specified queue(s),
for output at any subset of parts, with a queueing discipline specified
for each queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>This work describes a RMT chip architecture to provide an existence
proof of RMT to standardize the reconfiguration interface between the
controller and the data plane. The work also provide use cases that show
how the RMT model can be configured to implement forwarding using
Ethernet &amp; IP headers, and support RCP. The work describes an
implementation of a 64x10Gb/s RMT switch chip to show that a general
form of the RMT model is feasible &amp; inexpensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The RMT architecture has a reconfigurable parser. The parser output
is a packet header vector, which is a set of header fields such as IP
dest, Ethernet dest, etc. The packet header vector includes metadata
fields such as input port on which the packet arrived, router state
variables such as queue sizes.</li>
<li>The PHV flows through a sequence of logical match stages. Each
logical match stage is a logical unit of packet processing,
e.g.&#xA0;Ethernet or IP processing.</li>
<li>Packet modifications are done using VLIW action that operate on all
fields in the PHV concurrently.</li>
<li>A packet&#x2019;s fate is controlled by updating a set of dest
ports/queues.</li>
<li>Control flow is realized by an additional output,
next-table-address, from each table match that provides the index of the
next table to execute.</li>
<li>A recombination block at the end of the pipeline pushes PHV
modifications back into the packet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The work advocates an implementation architecture that consists of
large number of physical pipeline stages that are mapped to a smaller
number of logical RMT stages depending on the resource needs of each
logical stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Factoring State: Router forwarding has several stages, each using a
separate table, processed sequentially with dependencies, so a physical
pipeline is natural.</li>
<li>Flexible Resource Allocation Minimizing Resource Waste: The
resources for a logical stage can vary. E.g. a firewall requires all
ACLs, a core router requires only prefix matches, an edge router
requires both. But a physical stage has some CPU &amp; memory resource.
The number of physical stages, N, should be large enough to avoid
resource waste by a logical stage (max 1/N), and small enough to reduce
wiring &amp; power overheads. They use N=32.</li>
<li>Layout Optimality: A logical stage can be assigned more memory by
mapping multiple contiguous physical stages to it to reduce wiring
overheads.</li>
</ul>
<p>They found that the power requirement is not significant, and since
most use-cases are dominated by memory use, the coupling of processing
&amp; memory allocation is not significant in practice.</p>
<p>For terabit-speed realization, the needed to restrict physical match
stages to 32. The chip design limit of packet headers is 4Kb (512B).
They use 370Mb SRAM and 40Mb TCAM. Each stage may execute one
instruction per field &amp; limited to simple arithmetic, logical &amp;
bit manipulation. The queueing system provides 4 levels of hierarchy and
2K queues per port. Each stage contains over 200 action units, one for
each field in the PHV with over 7000 action units in the chip.</p>
<p>To configure the RMT architecture, one needs two pieces of
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parse graph that expresses permissibe header sequences</li>
<li>a table flow graph that expresses the set of match tables &amp;
control flow between them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>While RMT has been in discussions, it remained theoretical without
an existence proof of a chip design that works at terabit speeds. This
paper contributes a concrete RMT proposal &amp; a proof of it
feasibility.</li>
<li>The paper involves clever use of hardware pipelining &amp;
parallelizability to work at terabit speeds. Their use of memory blocks
that can be ganged within or across stages is key to realizing the
vision of reconfigurable match tables. The large scale use of TCAM
greatly increases matching flexibility, and use of fully-parallel VLIW
instructions is key to packet editing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>This paper is a proof of concept for RMT. One can investigate
different chip designs, including more optimizations, and remove some of
the restrictions.</li>
<li>Developing a compiler that maps the parse graphs &amp; table flow
graphs to the appropriate switch configurations &amp; perform optimized
memory allocation.</li>
</ul>
