Microkernel Approach to Host Networking</h1>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341301.3359657">Marty and De
Kruijf, et al.&#xA0;2019. Snap: a Microkernel Approach to Host Networking. In
ACM SIGOPS 27th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP &#x2019;19),
October 27&#x2013;30, 2019, Huntsville, ON, Canada. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15
pages. https://doi.org/ 10.1145/3341301.3359657</a></p>
<p>Host networking needs are evolving due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous capacity growth seeking new approaches to edge switching
&amp; bandwidth management</li>
<li>rise of cloud computing seeking rich virtualization features</li>
<li>high-performance distributed systems seeking efficient &amp; low
latency comms</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons for moving network functions from kernel-space to
user-space:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing kernel code is slow &amp; only few engineers could do
it</li>
<li>feature release through kernel module reloads covered a subset of
functionality &amp; required disconnecting apps</li>
<li>more common case required machine reboots which required draining
the machine of running apps</li>
<li>change of kernel-based stack took 1-2 months to deploy, whereas a
new Snap release done on a weekly basis</li>
<li>broad generality of Linux made optimization difficult &amp; defied
vertical integration efforts, which were easily broken by upstream
changes</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper presents a microkernel-inspired approach to host
networking called Snap. Snap is a userspace networking system with
flexible modules that implement various networking functions,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>edge packet switching</li>
<li>virtualization for cloud platforms</li>
<li>traffic shaping policy enforcement</li>
<li>high-performance reliable messaging</li>
<li>RDMA-like service</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems design principles for Snap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snap implements host networking functions as an ordinary Linux
userspace process (microkernel-inspired approach)
<ul>
<li>Retains centralized resource allocation &amp; management benefits of
monolithic kernel</li>
<li>High rate of feature development with transparent software
upgrades</li>
<li>Improves accounting &amp; isolation by accurately attributing both
CPU &amp; memory consumed on behalf of apps to those apps using Linux
kernel interfaces to charge CPU &amp; memory to app constainers</li>
<li>Leverages user-space security tools like memory access sanitizers,
fuzz testers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interoperable with existing kernel network functions &amp; app
thread schedulers
<ul>
<li>Implements custom kernel packet injection driver for packet
processing through both Snap &amp; Linux kernel networking stack</li>
<li>Implements custom CPU scheduler without adopting new runtimes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Encapsulates packet processing functions (data plane ops) into
composable units called &#x201C;engines&#x201D;
<ul>
<li>stateful, single-threaded tasks scheduled &amp; run by a Snap engine
scheduling runtime using lock-free communication over memory-mapped
regions shared with the input or output</li>
<li>enables modular CPU scheduling
<ul>
<li>engines are organized into groups sharing a common scheduling
discipline</li>
</ul></li>
<li>incremental &amp; minimally-disruptive state transfer during
upgrades</li>
<li>examples: packet processing for network virtualization, pacing, rate
limiting, stateful network transport like &#x201C;Pony Express&#x201D;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides support for OSI L4 &amp; L5 functions through Pony Express
transport
<ul>
<li>A Pony Express engine services incoming packets, interacts with
apps, runs state machines to advance messaging &amp; one-sided ops, and
generate outgoing packets</li>
<li>Interface similar to RDMA capable &#x201C;smart&#x201D; NIC</li>
<li>Transparently leverages stateless h/w offload capabilities in
emerging NICs
<ul>
<li>includes Intel I/OAT DMA device to offload memory copy ops</li>
<li>another example: end-to-end invariant CRC32 calculation over each
packet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Given zero-copy capability, NIC NUMA node locality &amp; locality
within the transport layer are together more important than locality
with the app thread, &amp; hence Pony Express runs transport processing
in a thread separate from the app, and instead shares CPU with other
engines &amp; other transport processing</li>
<li>Ability to rapidly deploy new versions of Pony Express significantly
aided development &amp; tuning of congestion control</li>
<li>Ability to easily update &amp; change wire protocols</li>
<li>Just-in-time generation of packets based on availability of NIC
transmit descriptor slots ensures no per-packet queueing in the
engine</li>
<li>One-sided ops don&#x2019;t involve app code on the remote destination &amp;
executes-to-completion within Pony Express engine
<ul>
<li>Supports rich operations such as &#x201C;indirect read&#x201D; to determine actual
memory target to access from local app-filled indirection tables, and
&#x201C;scan &amp; read&#x201D; - naive RDMA benefits disappear in these cases</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides mechanism to create message streams to avoid HoL
blocking</li>
<li>Flow control is mix of receiver-driven buffer posting as well as a
shared buffer pool managed using credits
<ul>
<li>Flow control for one-sided ops rely on congestion control &amp; CPU
scheduling mechanisms rather than higher-level mechanisms</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Highly tuned Snap &amp; Pony Express transport for performance to
minimize I/O overhead
<ul>
<li>3x better transport processing efficiency than baseline Linux</li>
<li>Supporting RDMA-like functionality at 5M IOPS/core</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transparent upgrades
<ul>
<li>Gives ability to release new Snap versions without disrupting
running apps</li>
<li>During upgrades, running version serializes all state to an
intermediate format stored in memory shared with new versions, migrating
engines one at a time, each in its entirety</li>
<li>Two-phase migration technique: brownout phase to perform preparatory
background transfer &amp; blackout phase when network stack is
unavailable</li>
<li>Targetted blackout period is 200 ms or less</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Customizable emphasis between scheduling latency, performance
isolation &amp; CPU efficiency of engines. Snap supports three broad
categories of scheduling modes for engine groups:
<ul>
<li>Dedicating cores
<ul>
<li>engines are pinned to dedicated hyperthreads on which no other work
can run</li>
<li>doesn&#x2019;t allow CPU utilization to scale in proportion to load</li>
<li>minimizes latency via spin polling</li>
<li>static provisioning can strain system under load or
overprovision</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spreading engines
<ul>
<li>scales CPU consumption in proportion to load to minimize scheduling
tail latency</li>
<li>binds each engine to a unique thread that schedules when active
&amp; blocks on interrupt notification (triggered from either NIC or
app) when idle</li>
<li>not subject to scheduling delays caused by multiplexing multiple
engines onto a small number of cores</li>
<li>leverages MicroQuanta, an internal real-time kernel scheduling
class, engines bypass default Linux CFS kernel scheduler &amp; can
quickly be scheduled to an available core upon interrupt delivery
<ul>
<li>a MicroQuanta thread runs for a configurable <em>runtime</em> out of
every <em>period</em> time units, with remaining CPU time available to
other CFS-scheduled tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>interrupts have system-level interference effects like being
scheduled to a core in a low-power sleep state or in midst of running
non-preemptible kernel code</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compacting engines
<ul>
<li>collapses work onto as few cores as possible combining scaling
advantages of interrupt-driven executing with cache-efficiency of
dedicating cores</li>
<li>but relies on periodic polling of engine queueing delays to detect
load imbalance instead of instantaneous interrupt signals</li>
<li>latency delay from polling engines plus the delay for statistical
confidence in queueing estimation plus the delay in handing off engine
to another core can be higher than latency of interrupt signaling</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The paper shows the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance measurement between a pair of machines connected to same
ToR switch, machines with Intel Skylake processor &amp; 100Gbps
NICs</li>
<li>Baseline, single-stream throughput of TCP is 22Gbps with 1.2 cores/s
utilization, &amp; Snap/Pony delivers 38Gbps using 1.05 cores/s</li>
<li>With 5000B MTU, Snap/Pony single-core throughput increases to over
67Gbps, &amp; enabling I/OAT receive copy offload (with zero-copy tx)
increases to over 80Gbps</li>
<li>Average RTT latency with TCP is 23 microsecs, &amp; Snap/Pony
delivers 18 microsecs. Configuration with spin-poll reduces Snap/Pony&#x2019;s
RTT latency to less than 10 microsecs and busy-polling sockets in Linux
reduces latency to 18 microsecs</li>
<li>Both Snap engine schedulers (&#x201C;spreading engines&#x201D; and &#x201C;compacting
engines&#x201D;) succeed in scaling CPU consumption in proportion to load &amp;
shows sub-linear increase in CPU consumption due to batching
efficiencies. Snap is 3x more efficient than TCP at high offered loads
due to:
<ul>
<li>copy reduction</li>
<li>avoiding fine-grained synchronization</li>
<li>5000B vs 4096B MTU difference between Snap/Pony &amp; TCP</li>
<li>hotter instruction &amp; data caches in case of the compacting
scheduler</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While Snap compacting scheduler offers the best CPU efficiency, the
spreading scheduler has the best tail latency</li>
<li>Spreading scheduler relies on interrupts to wake on idleness, which
is prone to system-level latency contributors - in these cases
compacting engines provide best latency
<ul>
<li>NIC generated interrupt might target a core in deep power-saving
C-state</li>
<li>Production machines run complex antagonists that can affect
schedulability of even a MicroQuanta thread</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conventional RPC stacks written on standard TCP sockets (gRPC) see
less than 100,000 IOPS/core, but Snap/Pony can provide up to 5M
IOPS/core with custom batched indirect read ops</li>
<li>Transparent upgrades with median blackout of 250ms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>This paper presents the design &amp; architecture of Snap, a
widely-deployed, microkernel-inspired system for host networking. They
also describe a communication stack based on this microkernel approach
&amp; transparent upgrade abilities without draining apps from running
machines. Snap has been running in production for 3 years (at the time
of the paper) supporting communication needs of several critical
systems. This shows that the design principles that they followed were
successful &amp; battle-hardened for Google-scale needs. They had
already experimented with various in-application transport designs &amp;
found the drawbacks exceed the strengths:
<ul>
<li>They prioritize fast release schedules of the network stack which
required them to decouple it from apps &amp; the kernel for the
transparent upgrades.</li>
<li>Most of the in-app transports required a spin-polling transport
thread with a provisioned core in every app to ameliorate scheduling
unpredictabilities. But this is impractical because it is common to run
dozens of apps on a single machine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They design three scheduling disciplines which can be customized
depending on the engine &amp; it&#x2019;s required emphasis between CPU
efficiency &amp; latency: dedicating cores, spreading engines &amp;
compacting engines. The abstraction of engine is helpful for both the
purpose of scheduling (through engine groups) as well as for supporting
transparent upgrades. This is a strength of the Snap design.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Much of the Snap scheduling mechanism relies on their
internally-developed kernel scheduling class called MicroQuanta which
provides a flexible way to share cores between latency-sensitive Snap
engine tasks &amp; other tasks, and also an internally-developed driver
for efficiently moving packets between Snap and the kernel. Without any
access into such internal tooling, one can only speculate their
functionality &amp; take their word for it. This makes the knowledge
accessible to the community at a very high-level without deep-level
understanding.</li>
<li>The paper doesn&#x2019;t go into the details of how they implement memory
management with Snap which is a significant challenge with non-kernel
networking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memory Mapping &amp; Management: Pony Express registers some
app-shared memory with the NIC for zero-copy transmit but does so
selectively and some apps take a copy from the app heap memory into
bounce buffer memory shared &amp; registerd with Snap and vice versa.
This means extra copies which can be avoided. Designing a custom system
call to translate &amp; temporarily pin the memory which is cheaper than
a memory copy can improve performance. In general, memory mapping &amp;
management with non-kernel networking is a significant challenge.</li>
<li>Dynamic CPU Scaling: Kernel TCP networking usage is very bursty in
practice - sometimes, consuming upwards of a dozen cores over short
bursts. Maybe there is a way to combine the CPU efficiency benefits of
compacting engines and the better tail latency benefits at high Snap
loads of spreading engines to achieve the best of both worlds. Scheduler
design for host networking hosts is a challenge.</li>
<li>Rebalancing Across Engines: One can consider fine-grained
rebalancing flows across engines using mechanisms such as work
stealing.</li>
<li>Stateful Offloads: Currently they leverage stateless offloads, and
do not mention about stateful h/w offloads in emerging h/w NICs.</li>
</ul>
