Independent Packet Processors</h1>
<p>Pat Bosshart, Dan Daly, Glen Gibb, Martin Izzard, Nick McKeown,
Jennifer Rexford, Cole Schlesinger, Dan Talayco, Amin Vahdat, George
Varghese, and David Walker. 2014. P4: programming protocol-independent
packet processors. SIGCOMM Comput. Commun. Rev.&#xA0;44, 3 (July 2014),
87&#x2013;95. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/2656877.2656890</p>
<p>The promise of SDN is that a single control place can directly
control a whole network of switches. OpenFlow (OF) supports this goal by
providing a single, vendor-agnostic API. But the control plane cannot
express how the packets howd be processed to best meet the needs of
control apps. OF v1.0 (Dec 2009) started simple with abstractions of a
single table of rules that could match packets on 12 header field,
e.g.&#xA0;MAC addresses, IP addresses, protocol, TCP/UDP port numbers, etc.
OF v1.4 (Oct 2013) specification requires 41 header fields. Datacenter
network operators want to apply new forms of packet encapsulation
(e.g.&#xA0;NVGRE, VXLAN, STT) requiring more header fields. This requires
repeatedly extending the OF specification. Instead P4 enables supporting
flexible mechanisms for parsing packets &amp; matching header fields,
allowing controller apps to leverage these capabilities.</p>
<p>The challenge is to find a sweet spot that balances:</p>
<ul>
<li>need for expressiveness
<ul>
<li>e.g.&#xA0;Click but it is difficult to infer dependencies &amp; map to
h/w</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ease of implementation across wide range of h/w &amp; s/w switches
<ul>
<li>e.g.&#xA0;OpenFlow 1.0 but it is impossible to reconfigure protocol
processing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>P4 has three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>reconfigurability in the field
<ul>
<li>controller can re-define packet parsing &amp; processing in the
field</li>
</ul></li>
<li>protocol independence
<ul>
<li>switch not tied to specific packet formats</li>
<li>controller can specify packet parser for extracting header fields
with specific names &amp; types</li>
<li>controller can specify a collection of typed match+action tables
that process these headers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>target independence
<ul>
<li>a compiler should take switch&#x2019;s capabilities into account when
turning a target-independent P4 description into a target-dependent
microcode program.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The work first describes an abstract forwarding model.</p>
<p>Switches forward packets via a programmable parser followed by
multiple stages of match+action, arranged in series, parallel, or a
combination of both.</p>
<ul>
<li>OF assumes a fixed parser. P4 supports a programmable parser to
allow new headers to be defined.</li>
<li>OF assumes match+action stages are in series. In P4, they can be in
parallel or in series.</li>
<li>P4 assumes actions are composed of protocol-independent primitives
supported by the switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This generalizes how packets are processed on different forwarding
devices - Ethernet switches, load-balancers, routers, etc. &amp; by
different technologies - fixed-function switch ASICs, NPUs,
reconfigurable switches, s/w switches, FPGAs. This allows using a common
language, P4, to represent how packets are processed.</p>
<p>The forwarding model is controlled by 2 ops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure
<ul>
<li>program the parser</li>
<li>set the order of match+action stages</li>
<li>specify the header fields processed by each stage</li>
<li>determines which protocols are supported</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Populate:
<ul>
<li>add/remove entries to the match+action tables specified during
configuration</li>
<li>determines the policy applied to the packets</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Arriving packets are first handled by the parser. The packet body is
buffered separately, unavailable for matching. The parser extracts the
fields from the header. The extracted header fields are passed to
match+action tables (ingress &amp; egress).</p>
<ul>
<li>ingress processing: forwarded, replicated (for multicast, span, or
to control plane), dropped, or trigger flow control</li>
<li>egress processing: per-instance modifications to header - e.g.&#xA0;for
multicast copies</li>
</ul>
<p>A packet processing language must allow the programmer to express any
serial dependencies between header fields. Dependencies determine which
tables can be executed in parallel. Dependencies can be identified by
analyzing the Table Dependency Graphs (TDG) which describe the field
inputs, actions, and control flow between tables.</p>
<p>They propose a 2-step compilation process:</p>
<ul>
<li>programmers express packet processing programs using an imperative
language representing the control flow (P4)</li>
<li>a compiler translates the P4 representation to TDGs to facilitate
dependency analysis and then maps the TDG to a specific swtich target
using a target specific back-end.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key concepts in P4 are: headers, parsers, tables, actions,
control programs.</p>
<p>They explore P4 by examining a simple example. They consider a L2
network deployment with ToR switches at the edge connected by a two-tier
core. The number of end-hosts is growing and the core L2 tables are
overflowing. P4 lets us express a custom solution with minimal changes
to the network architecture. The routes through the core are encoded by
a 32-bit tag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Header: First, we add a new header, <code>mTag</code> with fields
8-bit <code>up1</code>, <code>up2</code>, <code>down1</code>,
<code>down2</code>, and 16-bit <code>ethertype</code>.</li>
<li>Packet Parser: P4 assumes the underlying switch can implement a
state machine that traverses packet headers from start to finish,
extracting field values as it goes. Parsing starts in the
<code>start</code> state and proceeds until an explicit
<code>stop</code> state is reached or an unhandled case is encountered
(error). The extracted headers are forwarded to match+action processing
in the next-half of the switch pipeline.</li>
<li>Table Specification: The programmer then describes how the defined
header fields are matched in match+action stages (e.g.&#xA0;exact, prefix,
wildcards, etc.) and what actions should be performed when a match
occurs.</li>
<li>Action Specification: P4 defines a collection of primitive actions
from which more complicated actions are built. The programmer specifies
the complex actions made up of primitive actions such as
<code>set_field</code>, <code>copy_field</code>,
<code>add_header</code>, <code>remove_header</code>,
<code>increment</code>, <code>checksum</code>. P4 assumes parallel
execution of primitives within an action function.</li>
<li>Control Program: The programmer then specifies the control flow from
one table to another via an imperative representation using functions,
conditionals and table references.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>This work unlocks the potential of SDNs further by proposing a
configuration language &amp; compilers that generate low-level
target-specific configurations including h/w optimizations to provide
greater expressivity instead of repeatedly extending the OpenFlow
specification to meet the needs of control plane applications.</li>
<li>The work stresses on resolving dependencies between match+action
tables to parallelize the execution as much as possible on the switch
h/w. P4 is designed to make it easy to translate an imperative control
program into a table dependency graph. The design also lets the compiler
optimize for the specific target: support RAM &amp; TCAM, parallel
tables, few tables, final writes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li>SDN is successful because one can control a whole network of
switches, which led to cost savings as well (by simplifying the switch
functionality to only provide forwarding), even though one had to
re-write interfaces for applications. Even though P4 supports the goal
of SDN offering more flexibility to the controller applications, P4
would have limited or no benefits with low-cost targets like
fixed-function switches. The potential targets of P4 are expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>The work emphasizes that P4 is a first step towards more
expressivity in the data plane. In this proposal, several aspects of a
switch are undefined: e.g. congestion control primitives, queueing
disciplines, traffic monitoring. Each of these are areas of future
work.</li>
</ul>
