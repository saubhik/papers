<p>This paper presents Azure Accelerated Networking (AccelNet), a
solution for offloading host networking to hardware using custom Azure
SmartNICs based on FPGAs, providing &lt;15 microseconds VM-VM TCP
latencies and 32 Gbps throughput, since 2016.</p>
<p>Azure has built its cloud network on host-based SDN technologies,
through software running in the hypervisor, to implement a rich &amp;
changing set of virtual networking features, in order to sell
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).</p>
<ul>
<li>private virtual networks with customer supplied address spaces</li>
<li>scalable L4 load balancers</li>
<li>security groups &amp; Access Control Lists (ACLs)</li>
<li>virtual routing tables</li>
<li>bandwidth metering</li>
<li>QoS</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>The <em>Virtual Filtering Platform (VFP)</em> is a cloud-scale
programmable vSwitch, providing scalable SDN policy for Azure. It is
highly programmable and serviceable.</p>
<p><em>Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)</em> reduces CPU
utilization by allowing VM to directly access NIC hardware. The host
connects to a privileged physical function (PF), while each virtual
machine connects to its own virtual function (VF). An SR-IOV NIC
contains an embedded switch to forward packets to the right VF based on
the MAC address.</p>
<p><em>Generic Flow Tables (GFT)</em> is a match-action language that
defines transformation &amp; control operations on packets for a
specific network flow. This mechanism is used in VFP to enforce policy
&amp; filtering in an SR-IOV environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Need &amp; Desired Goals</strong></p>
<p>Burning CPUs for these services takes away from the processing power
available to customer VMs and increases the overall cost of providing
cloud services. The authors need a cost-effective solution providing
hardware-like performance with software-like programmability with the
following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Don&#x2019;t burn host CPU cores for network processing.</em> A single
physical core with 2 hyper-threads is worth $4500 (2016) for an IaaS
provider.</li>
<li><em>Maintain host SDN programmability of VFP.</em> Competitive edge
of Azure for providing highly-configurable &amp; feature-rich virtual
networks to IaaS customers</li>
<li><em>Achieve the latency, throughput, and utilization of SR-IOV
hardware.</em></li>
<li><em>Support new SDN workloads and primitives over time.</em></li>
<li><em>Rollout new functionality to entire fleet.</em></li>
<li><em>Provide high single-connection performance.</em> With
software-based SDN, single core network processing cannot achieve
40Gbps+ bandwidth.</li>
<li><em>Have a path to scale to 100Gb+.</em></li>
<li><em>Retain serviceability.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deciding-the-right-hardware---fpgas-as-smartnics">Deciding the
right hardware - FPGAs as SmartNICs</h3>
<ul>
<li>ASICs provide high performance but lack programmability, and
adaptability. Takes 1-2 years from specifications to arrival.</li>
<li>Embedded cores in ASICs become a performance bottleneck &amp;
requires vendor-specific firmware updates.</li>
<li>SoCs are easier to program and performant for 10GbE NICs. But
requires lot of cores &amp; bad single-flow performance at higher speeds
of 40GbE+. Not scalable to 100GbE+.</li>
<li>FPGAs can take advantage of application characteristics to configure
logic blocks and memories, and hence are programmable. They give
performance &amp; efficiency of customized hardware &amp; deep
processing pipelines improve single-flow performance.</li>
<li>Cost &amp; performance overheads of burning host CPU cores are very
high.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-architecture">Design &amp; Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>They augmented the current SR-IOV compatible NIC with the FPGA, and
developed the FPGA to offload the SDN functionality. The FPGA is in
between the NIC and the ToR switch, making it a network filter. It is
also connected by 2 Gen3x8 PCIe connections to the CPUs for AI &amp; web
search accelerator workloads (Gen 1).</li>
<li>Control plane remains unchanged handled by VFP in host hypervisor.
Only data plane offloaded to FPGA.</li>
<li>NIC driver augmented with GFT Lightweight Filter (LWF) driver
abstracting details of split NIC/FPGA hardware from VFP &amp; makes it
appear as a single NIC with SR-IOV and GFT support.</li>
<li>FPGA contains GFT Engine which might not contain matching rule for a
packet, in which case the FPGA will send the packet to the hypervisor&#x2019;s
vPort in the SR-IOV NIC (monitored by VFP) as an Exception Packet (first
packet of a flow). VFP determines appropriate policy for the packet&#x2019;s
flow &amp; performs necessary flow creation tasks.</li>
<li>GFT implementation on FPGA has 2 deeply pipelined packet processing
units each with 4 major stages: store &amp; forward packet buffer,
parser, flow lookup &amp; match, and flow action. The Parser parses
aggregated header from each packet and outputs a unique key for each
flow. Matching block computes Toeplitz hash of the key and indexes into
a 2-level caching system. Action block uses parameter looked up from
flow table and performs the transformations on the packet header.</li>
<li>Software-programmable QoS guarantees like rate limiting can be
implemented as components of the processing pipeline.</li>
<li>GFT keeps track of all per-connection byte/flow counters, h/w
timestamps of packets in each flow &amp; periodically transmits all flow
state state to VFP via DMA transfers over PCIe.</li>
<li>GFT maintains generation ID of policy state &amp; tracks it when
rules for each flow were created. On policy update to VFP, the
generation ID on the SmartNIC is incremented, and then the flows are
updated lazily by marking first packet of each flow as an Exception
Packet.</li>
<li><em>Online serviceability:</em> TCP flows and vNICs survive FPGA
reconfiguration, FPGA driver updates, NIC PF driver updates, &amp; GFT
driver updates. When the VF comes up, the synthetic NIC driver (NetVSC)
marks VF as its slave &amp; leverages transparent bonding to make the
TCP/IP stack completely transparent to the current data path. During
servicing, all transmit traffic switches to the synthetic path. They
included a failsafe PMD (Poll Mode Driver) to act as a bond between the
VF PMD &amp; synthetic PMD, exposing DPDK APIs for safe failover to
non-accelerated code path during servicing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>For 1-way latency between two Windows Server 2016 VMs &amp; sending
1 million 4-byte pings sequentially over active TCP connections
<ul>
<li>With a tuned software stack without AccelNet, average of 50
microseconds, with a P99 around 100 microseconds, and P99.9 around 300
microseconds.</li>
<li>With AccelNet, average of 17 microseconds with P99 of 25
microseconds, and P99.9 of 80 microseconds - much lower latency and
variance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With pairs of both Ubuntu 16.04 VMs and Windows 10 VMs with TCP
congestion control set to CUBIC and 1500 Byte MTU, VM-VM
single-connection throughput is 31Gbps on 32Gbps network, with 0%
associated host CPU utilization. Without AccelNet, single connection is
5Gbps &amp; need ~8 connections on multiple cores to achieve line
rate.</li>
<li>AccelNet has lowest latencies, highest throughput, lowest tail
latencies when compared with other public cloud offerings.</li>
<li>Power draw of the Gen1 board is at 17-19W depending on traffic load,
well below the 25W allowed for PCIe expansion slot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths-weaknesses">Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper detailed the Azure SmartNIC, a FPGA-based programmable
NIC, as well as Accelerated Networking, a service for high performance
network providing cloud-leading network performance. Both Azure
SmartNICs and AccelNet have been deployed at scale for multiple years,
3-4 years, with 100s of 1000s of customer VMs across Azure flee. So, the
design choices both in the hardware and the software &amp; system design
made in this paper were extremely successful in improving network
performance without impacting serviceability and reliability.</li>
<li>The paper also stressed on the non-technical but critical issue of
divide between hardware and software development practices and teams,
&amp; attempted to solve them, some of which can be credited to the use
of FPGA.
<ul>
<li>The paper devotes considerable sections to convince the host
networking team to adopt the use of FPGA as a SmartNIC as they were not
in the business of digital logic design or SystemVerilog
programming.</li>
<li>The authors mention that hardware devs should be in the same team as
software devs for successful hardware/software co-design such as the
SmartNIC.</li>
<li>They treated and shipped hardware logic as if it was software. Going
through iterative rings of software qualification means they didn&#x2019;t need
ASIC levels of specification &amp; verification upfront &amp; could be
more agile.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper heavily stresses on serviceability as an important
operationalization metric for large-scale deployment of a solution. They
have implemented fallback mechanisms to fall back to a non-accelerated
code path during servicing the FPGA SmartNIC or driver updates. But, for
RDMA applications this serviceability is harder, and they rely on the
RDMA application characteristic of graceful fallback to TCP to close all
RDMA queue pairs. This is more of a future work: app-level transparency
for RDMA serviceability if apps have a hard dependency on RDMA queue
pairs staying alive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>This paper describes functions which were being done in hypervisor
software (VFP) and offloaded to the hardware for greater performance.
Future work will need to investigate new functionality that can be
supported due to the presence of programmable NICs on every host.</li>
<li>Investigate mechanisms for app-level transparency for RDMA
serviceability if apps have a hard dependency on RDMA queue pairs
staying alive. (see above)</li>
</ul>
