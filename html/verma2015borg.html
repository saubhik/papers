<p>Google&#x2019;s Borg system is a cluster manager that:</p>
<ul>
<li>runs 100s of 1000s of jobs</li>
<li>from many 1000s of apps</li>
<li>across a number of clusters</li>
<li>each cluster having 10s of 1000s of machines</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieves high utilization by combining admission control, efficient
task packing, over-commitment &amp; machine sharing with process-level
performance isolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users submit their work to Borg in the form of jobs. A job consists
of one or more tasks that all run the same program (binary). Each job
runs in one Borg cell. A Borg cell is a set of machines belonging to a
single cluster. A cluster lives in a single DC building, and a
collection of buildings makes up a site.</li>
<li>Workload: heterogenous with two parts:
<ul>
<li>long-running, highly available, latency-sensitive, end-user facing
services (e.g.&#xA0;Gmail, Google Docs, web search, BigTable), few us to few
100s of ms, diurnal usage patterns. Classified as &#x201C;prod&#x201D;.</li>
<li>batch jobs taking a few secs to a few days to complete, much less
sensitive to short-term performance fluctuations. Classified as
&#x201C;non-prod&#x201D;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heterogeneous machines in a cell, in many dimensions: CPU, RAM, disk
and network sizes, processor type, performance, capabilities such as
external IP address or flash storage.</li>
<li>Job&#x2019;s properties include name, owner &amp; number of tasks it has,
constraints to force tasks to run on machines with particular attributes
such as processor architecture, OS version, external IP address. A task
maps to set of Linux processes A task maps to set of Linux
processes.</li>
<li>Users operate on jobs by issuing RPCs to Borg from a cmdline tool,
other jobs, or monitoring system. Job descriptions are written in a
declarative configuration lang, BCL. Jobs can be <code>submit</code>ted
and <code>accept</code>ed to <code>Pending</code> state, and get
<code>schedule</code>d to <code>Running</code> state, and then
<code>finish</code> to <code>Dead</code> state. <code>fail, kill,
lost</code> leads to <code>Dead</code>. <code>evict</code> from
<code>Running</code> leads to <code>Pending</code> (pre-emption).</li>
<li>A Borg <code>alloc</code> is a reserved set of resources on a
machine in which one or more tasks can be run. Analogous concept is
<code>pod</code> in Kubernetes. An alloc set is a group of allocs that
reserve resources on multiple machines.
<ul>
<li>To set resources aside for future tasks</li>
<li>To retain resources b/w stopping a task &amp; starting it again</li>
<li>Gather tasks from different jobs onto same machine - webserver &amp;
logsaver task (copy server&#x2019;s URL logs from local disk to distributed
FS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When more work shows up than can be accommodated, they use
priorities &amp; quota.
<ul>
<li>Every job has a <code>priority</code>, a small positive integer,
expressing relative importance of the job that are running or waiting to
run in a cell. A high-priority task can obtain resources at the expense
of a lower-priority one, even if that involves preempting the latter. To
prevent preemption cascades, they disallow tasks in production priority
band to preempt one another.</li>
<li>Quota decides which jobs to admit for scheduling. It is a vector of
resource quantities (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.) at a given priority for a
period of time. Quota-checking is part of admission control.
Over-selling quota at lower-priority levels to avoid over-buying quota.
Quota allocation is outside Borg, and tied to Google&#x2019;s physical capacity
planning. User jobs are only admitted if they have sufficient quota at
the required priority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A service&#x2019;s clients use the BNS (Borg Name Service) name to find a
task. Forms the basis for the task&#x2019;s DNS name:
<code>taskID.jobName.userName.cellName.borg.google.com</code>. Every
task contains a built-in HTTP server to publish information about task
health &amp; performance metrics (e.g.&#xA0;RPC latencies). A UI service
(Sigma) provides a dashboard.</li>
<li>Borg architecture: Logically centralized controller, Borgmaster, and
agent process called Borglet running on each machine in the cell.
<ul>
<li>Borgmaster: main process + separate scheduler.
<ul>
<li>main process handles client RPCs that mutate state or provide RO
access to data. Manages state machines for all objects (machines, tasks,
allocs). Communicates with Borglets. Offers a backup web UI to Sigma.
Replicated 5 times for fault tolerance. Paxos leader is the state
mutator. Periodic checkpointing + change logs for fault tolerance &amp;
debugging &amp; capacity planning.</li>
<li>Job&#x2019;s tasks added to pending queue on submission by Borgmaster.
Pending queue is scanned from high to low priority, round-robin scheme
within a priority to ensure fairness across users &amp; avoid HoL
blocking, by scheduler. Two parts: feasibility checking &amp; scoring.
<ul>
<li>feasibility checking: find machines that meet the task&#x2019;s constraints
&amp; have enough &#x201C;available&#x201D; resources - including resources assigned
to lower-priority tasks that can be evicted</li>
<li>scoring: score each feasible machine based on user-specified
preferences, &amp; built-in criteria (minimize the no. &amp; priority of
preempted tasks, pick machines having a copy of the task&#x2019;s packages to
reduce task startup time, spreading tasks across power &amp; failure
domains, packing quality). The scoring model tries to reduce amount of
stranded resources that cannot be used because another resource on the
machine is fully allocated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Borglet starts &amp; stops tasks, restarts them if they fail, manage
local resources by manipulating OS kernel settings, rolls over debug
logs, reports the state of the machine to the Borgmaster &amp; other
monitoring systems. The Borgmaster polls each Borglet every few secs to
retrieve the current state &amp; send any outstanding requests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To scale, they split the scheduler into a separate process so it
could operate in parallel with other replicated Borgmaster functions.
Separate threads to talk to the Borglets &amp; respond to read-only RPCs
improve response times. More scalability optimizations:
<ul>
<li>score caching: ignore small changes in resource quantities reduces
cache invalidations.</li>
<li>equivalence classes: feasibility checking &amp; scoring for one task
per equivalence class (identical requirements &amp; constraints).</li>
<li>relaxed randomization: examine machines in a random order until
enough feasible machines to score &amp; select the best.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A key-design feature for availability is that already-running tasks
continue to run even if the Borgmaster or a task&#x2019;s Borglet goes
down.</li>
<li>Increasing utilization by a few percentage points can save millions
of dollars. &#x201C;Cell compaction&#x201D; is chosen as utilization metric: given a
workload, how small a cell it could be fitted into? Better scheduling
policies require fewer machines to run on the same workload.
<ul>
<li>Cell sharing: segregating prod &amp; non-prod work would need more
machines because prod jobs usually reserve resources to handle rare
workload spikes but don&#x2019;t use these resources most of the time. Borg&#x2019;s
resource reclamation run non-prod work using reclaimed resources. The
CPU slowdown (increase in CPI) by packing unrelated users &amp; job
types onto the same machine is outweighed by decrease in machines
required.</li>
<li>Large cells: Allows large computations, &amp; decrease resource
fragmentation.</li>
<li>Fine-grained resource requests: Request CPU in milli-cores, and
memory &amp; disk-space in bytes (core = processor hyperthread).
Offering fized-size CPU &amp; memory would require more machines.</li>
<li>Resource reclamation: A job specifies a resource limit - to
determine if user has enough quota for admission. Borgmaster estimates
how much resources a task will use (reservation) every few seconds based
on usage information captured by Borglet &amp; reclaim the rest for
batch work. This reduces the number of machines used. Reservation -
Usage = Safety Margin. Too less safety margin leads to OOMs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They use a Linux chroot jail as the primary security isolation
mechanism between multiple tasks on the same machine &amp; VMs &amp;
security sandboxing techniques are used to run external software by
Google&#x2019;s AppEngine &amp; Google Compute Engine.</li>
<li>Borg tasks run inside a Linux cgroup-based resource contained &amp;
Borglet manipulates the container settings, giving improved control.
<ul>
<li>Borg tasks have an <code>appclass</code>: latency-sensitive (LS)
&amp; batch. High-priority LS tasks receive best treatment.</li>
<li>Compressible (CPU cycles, disk I/O bandwidth) &amp; non-compressible
resources (memory, disk): if a machine runs out of non-compressible
resources, Borglet immediately terminates tasks from lowest to highest
priority; if a machine runs out of compressible resources, the Borglet
throttles usage (favoring LS tasks) so that short load spikes can be
handled without killing any tasks.</li>
<li>To reduce scheduling delays, their version of CFS uses extended
per-cgroup load history, allows preemption of batch tasks by LS tasks,
reduces scheduling quantum when multiple LS tasks are runnable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the design they gave importance to debugging
(instrospection) by surfacing debugging information to all users rather
than hiding it. To handle the enormous volume of data, they provide
several levels of UI &amp; debugging tools so users can quickly identify
anomalous events related to their jobs &amp; then drill down to detailed
event &amp; errors logs from their applications &amp; infrastructure
itself.</li>
<li>Another important part of managing large scale clusters is
automation &amp; operator scaleout: Borg&#x2019;s design allows them to support
10s of 1000s of machines per operator (SRE).</li>
<li>The qualitative lessons they learned from operating Borg in
production for more than a decade were incorporated in Kubernetes which
has become extremely popular now:
<ul>
<li>allocs are useful: allows helper services to be developed by
separate teams &amp; this abstraction spawned the widely-used logsaver
pattern &amp; data-loader+webserver pattern.</li>
<li>cluster management is more than task management: apps on Borg
benefit from other cluster services such as naming &amp; load balancing,
apart from lifecycle management of tasks &amp; machines.</li>
<li>master is the kernel of a distributed system: although originally
built as a monolithic system, Borgmaster became a kernel sitting at the
heart of an ecosystem of services that cooperate to manage user jobs:
scheduler, UI (Sigma), admission control, vertical &amp; horizontal
auto-scaling, re-packing tasks, periodic job submission, workflow
management, archiving system actions for offline querying. Affording
this scaling of workload &amp; feature set without sacrificing
performance, scalability &amp; maintainability is hallmark of a good
design.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li>The only form of data locality supported by the Borg scheduler is
sharing &amp; caching immutable packages used by different tasks. The
scheduler doesn&#x2019;t take into account low-level resource interference:
such as memory bandwidth contention or L3 cache pollution. Maybe the
scheduler can be further improved.</li>
<li>As discussed in the paper:
<ul>
<li>Jobs are restrictive as the only grouping mechanism for tasks: no
way to manage multi-job service as a single entity or related instances
of a service (canary &amp; production tracks). K8s solves this by using
<code>labels</code> - arbitrary key-value paris that user can attach to
any object in the system.</li>
<li>One IP address per machine complicates things: Borg needed to
schedule ports as a resource, assign ports to tasks, enforce port
isolation &amp; RPC systems needed to handle ports as well as IP
addresses. K8s uses Linux namespaces, VMs, IPv6 &amp; SDN to give an IP
address to every pod &amp; service.</li>
<li>Optimizing for power users at the expense of casual ones: the BCL
specification lists about 230 parameters &amp; makes it harder for the
casual user to use Borg.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Borg, as described in this paper, is only suitable for Google&#x2019;s
workloads and Google&#x2019;s machines. The design choices that affected their
system are extremely Google-specific. To cite an instance: the vast
majority of the Borg worklaod does not run inside VMs - a reason being
the system was designed at a time when Google had made a considerable
investment in processors with no virtualization support in hardware. But
of course, the paper presents many ideas to build such a cluster
management system.</li>
<li>Not enough motivation (quantitatively) provided for choosing &#x201C;cell
compaction&#x201D; as the utilization metric for Borg&#x2019;s design. They just say
that they picked this metric after much experimentation and the details
are avoided. They mention cell compaction gives a fair, consistent way
to compare scheduling policies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>As discussed above, work continues in improving the scheduler.
Adding thread placement &amp; CPU management that is NUMA-,
hyperthreading-, and power-aware &amp; improving the control fidelity of
the Borglet.</li>
<li>Even though K8s is being actively developed, maybe rewriting the BCL
to support a simpler API for casual users might be a potential future
work.</li>
</ul>
